# MendeleevAPI: Spring-based Periodic Table API

Introduction:

MendeleevAPI is a Spring-based web application that serves as an API for accessing information about chemical elements from the periodic table. Leveraging the power of the Spring Framework, this project provides a robust and scalable platform for retrieving data related to elements, such as atomic properties, groups, periods, and more.

Features:

    Element Retrieval: Endpoint to retrieve information about individual elements by their atomic number, symbol, or name.
    Periodic Table Overview: Endpoint to retrieve an overview of the entire periodic table, including groups, periods, and element details.
    Atomic Calculations: Functionality to perform atomic calculations, such as calculating the atomic mass of a given element.

Usage:

    Clone the Repository:

```bash

    git clone https://github.com/your-username/mendeleev-api.git

```

    Open Project in IntelliJ IDEA:
        Open IntelliJ IDEA.
        Click on "Open or Import" and select the cloned mendeleev-api directory.
    Configure Database (if necessary):
        If the project requires a database setup or configuration within IntelliJ IDEA, follow the project-specific instructions to set it up.

    Run the Application:
        Locate the DemoApplication.java class in the project structure.
        Right-click on DemoApplication.java and select "Run DemoApplication".

    Access API Endpoints:
        Once the application is running, you can access the API endpoints using a web browser or a tool like Postman.
        Use the provided endpoints such as /api/elements/{atomicNumber} or /api/periodic-table to retrieve element information.

    Test and Explore:
        Test the functionality of the API endpoints to ensure they are working as expected.
        Explore the project structure and codebase within IntelliJ IDEA to understand how the application is implemented.

Note:

    Ensure that all necessary dependencies are resolved within IntelliJ IDEA to avoid any compilation or runtime errors.
    Make sure to configure any environment-specific settings or properties required for the application to run smoothly within IntelliJ IDEA.
